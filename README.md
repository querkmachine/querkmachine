Hello world, I'm **beeps**, a Bristol-based frontend developer currently working on the [GOV.UK Design System](http://design-system.service.gov.uk/), a product of the [Government Digital Service](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-digital-service). 

Some things to know:

* 🏳️‍⚧️ My pronouns are it/its. Use them.
* 🤖 I'm a bit of a transhumanist. I don't readily identify as being human and don't particularly want to be.
* 🌈 I'm queer as heck: trans, agender, asexual, panromantic, poly. If you don't support trans rights, stay outta my sight.
* 🐾 I'm also a furry (shocker). My fursonas are a robot Honduran white bat and a shapeshifting alien critter.
* 🖊️ I write about all of the above on my blog, [beeps.website/blog](https://beeps.website/blog).
* 🦣 I tootle about on Mastodon too, [@batbeeps@chitter.xyz](https://chitter.xyz/@batbeeps).

The government's views are not my own, or vice versa.
