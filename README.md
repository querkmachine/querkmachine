Hello world, [I'm **beeps**](https://beeps.website/about/name/), a Bristol-based frontend developer currently working on the [GOV.UK Design System](http://design-system.service.gov.uk/), a product of the [Government Digital Service](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-digital-service). I care about accessibility, design systems, and the semantic web (the *real* Web 3.0). 

## beeps is…

* 🏳️‍⚧️ …an [it/its pronoun user](https://beeps.website/about/gender/). Use them.
* 🌈 …queer as heck. I'm [trans agender](https://beeps.website/about/gender/), [asexual, panromantic](https://beeps.website/about/asexuality/), and polyamorous. Trans rights are human rights.
* 🤖 …[a bit of a transhumanist](https://beeps.website/about/nonhuman/). I don't readily identify as being human and don't particularly want to be.
* 🧠 …[neurodivergent](https://beeps.website/about/neurodivergent/) and [plural](https://beeps.website/about/olive/) too. Brains are weird.
* 🐾 …[a furry](https://beeps.website/about/furry/) (shocker). My fursona is [a shapeshifting alien critter](https://beeps.website/ash/) who represents me basically everywhere.
* 💻 …[a civil servant and frontend developer](https://beeps.website/about/work/), but you knew that already.

I write about all of the above on [my blog](https://beeps.website/blog/) and I [tootle about on Mastodon](https://social.beeps.gay/@beeps) too.

The government's views are not my own.
