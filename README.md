# üëãÔ∏è Hello, I'm beeps

I‚Äôm a Bristol-based [front-end website developer](https://beeps.website/) specialising in accessibility, design systems, and the semantic web. I currently work at the [Government Digital Service](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-digital-service) on the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk).

I'm an [agender](https://beeps.website/about/gender/) (it/its or they/them pronouns), aggressively [asexual](https://beeps.website/about/asexuality/), [alterhuman robot-identifying person](https://beeps.website/about/robot/). I'm also a [furry](https://beeps.website/about/furry/). It's all a bit complicated.
