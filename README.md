# 👋️ Hello, I'm Kim (she/her)

🕸️🧑‍💻 I'm a [front-end website developer](https://berly.kim) specialising in accessibility. I currently work for the [Government Digital Service](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-digital-service) on the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk).

🤖🦇 I'm also [a furry](https://berly.kim/blog/2022-04-10-a-robot-bat-on-the-internet/). My fursona is a robotic Honduran white bat. Her name is Emy. She beeps.
